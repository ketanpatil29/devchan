Whether you’re looking for  coding buddy, a project collaborator, a tech friend, or someone to discuss ideas with devChan connects you with the right people.

## devChan — Developer Channel

Welcome to devChan — a platform where developers connect, collaborate, and grow together.

Inspired by swipe-based matching platforms, devChan helps developers discover like-minded people based on skills, interests, and goals — not looks.

Users authenticate using GitHub, build a detailed developer profile, and get matched with other developers who share similar interests, skills, or tech stacks.

This is developer networking.

-> ⬆️ Skip / move on

-> Send a connection request after liking
